  #Vampire
  ek_secret_trait_event.0001.t:0 "A Lust for Blood"
  ek_secret_trait_event.0001.desc:0 "I thirst for #bold blood#!. This unceasing hunger is my lot as a Vampire, something I cannot shake off as it beckons my very own soul. As I take sight of my situation I cannot help but wonder whether I should drop all pretense or cling to the shadows. While I can hide for now, a better opportunity to reveal myself may one day arrive - or I might be denounced unexpectedly!\n\nThis is a crucial decision as much of the world is unforgiving to my ilk..."
  ek_secret_trait_event.0001.option1:0 "I will leave them in the dark."  
  ek_secret_trait_event.0001.option2:0 "Hmmm, fear will refine the taste of their blood... Ha ha ha!"  
  #Lycanthrope
  ek_secret_trait_event.0002.t:0 "The Beast Within"
  ek_secret_trait_event.0002.desc:0 "A beast calls inside me, eager to consume, rip and tear its prey. Lycanthropes know this feeling all too well and its consequences lead us to hide from the public. By keeping a low profile I can avoid the anger that many would channel in my direction. Yet revealing who I really am could be the right move.\n\nWhat to do, follow the herd or bring out the fangs? "
  ek_secret_trait_event.0002.option1:0 "I should not tempt public outrage."  
  ek_secret_trait_event.0002.option2:0 "#bold Rawr#! I do not concern myself with the opinion of prey!"  
  #Necromancer
  ek_secret_trait_event.0003.t:0 "Skeletons in the Closet"
  ek_secret_trait_event.0003.desc:0 "I play with life and death — mostly the latter by engaging in the Dark Arts: Necromancy. The feeling of toying with the undead is one of many a skilled mage may know but which the majority of the world considers utterly sinful!\n\nThus I must choose carefully, do I tell everyone that I practice Necromancy or keep my skills to myself?"
  ek_secret_trait_event.0003.option1:0 "My plans will be easier if I omit this information."  
  ek_secret_trait_event.0003.option2:0 "They #bold will#! serve! Dead or alive..."
