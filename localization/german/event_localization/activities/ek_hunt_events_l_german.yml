 ek_hunt.1001.desc:0 "As the hunt goes on, you find yourself separated from your group, and in a part of the hunting grounds you have never seen before.\nAround you the singing of the birds and the various noises made by bigger beasts have grown quiet, and you can feel a higher presence overseeing this land.\n\nAs you slowly press on, you find a small and secluded shrine, dedicated to none other than the Daedric Prince Hircine, Father of the Hunt and Prince of Lycanthropy!"
 ek_hunt.1001.a:0 "This place is cursed, I will destroy this shrine!"
 ek_hunt.1001.a.tt:0 "The Prince will be midly displeased, and your hunting party might find itself without any prey to catch..."

 ek_hunt.1002.desc:0 "As I take a nightly stroll through the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TerrainType')], I think about that time I killed the great white [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')]. As I ponder and reminisce about that event, a ghostly [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] appears before me. Before I can ready my [ROOT.Char.Custom('signature_weapon')], the apparition starts speaking in a loud, deep voice.\n\n"Well met, hunter. I am the spirit of the hunt, just one glimpse of the glorious stalker that your kind calls Hircine, and what I offer you is an eternal hunt. Serve me, and you shall be granted plenty of prey in my Hunting Grounds."\n\nAstonished, I struggle to find my words."
 ek_hunt.1002.a:0 "Take that, you demon! Begone!"
 ek_hunt.1002.a.tt:0 "You strike the creature with your [ROOT.Char.Custom('signature_weapon')], but the beast is faster and darts away."

 ek_hunt.1003.desc:0 "As the hunt goes on through the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TerrainType')], me and my group find ourselves surrounded by plant-like creatures shaped like a female humanoid who commanded a group of wild [activity.Custom('GetAnimalPlural')]. I heard someone shout "Spriggans!" before the kerfuffle started. Spriggans are known as sacred protectors of nature, highly revered by those who worship nature in their daily practices.\n\nI can't help but wonder if this area is being targeted by hunters too much."

I heard a low growl and suddenly I was alone with the thing.\n\nIts eyes were almost human but in all other aspects it was a wolf. I remembered the bedtime stories I was told as a little [ROOT.Char.Custom('GirlBoy')], where regular people turned into monsters when one of the moons was full. The thing paced around me slowly, getting a good look at me while sniffing.\n\nI had to act, quickly."
 ek_hunt.1004.a:0 "Come on! You monster!"

I heard a high-pitched screech and suddenly I was alone with the thing.\n\nIts eyes were bloodshot and crazied and it was covered in blood. I remembered the bedtime stories I was told as a little [ROOT.Char.Custom('GirlBoy')], where regular people would be turned by vampires into feral creatures known as bloodfiends. The thing was staring directly at me.\n\nI had to act, quickly."

ek_hunt.1007.desc:0 "While scouting the land for game, I stepped on a rock that pushed me back. Stepping back and preparing myself for the worst, my entourage and I witnessed the "rock" stand up and try to pinch my leg.\n\nIt was a mudcrab, a pretty common sight around this area, but annoying nonetheless."
